# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- First release for ShareOS (requires ShareOS 0.2.0-beta.9+ and system apps `autobrr` + `transmission-daemon`).
- Integrated directly with the firmware daemon via `ShareOS.autobrr` (permissions `files`, `autobrr`, and `torrent` for admin accounts).
- Automatic torrent hand-over: dispatches matching releases to the dedicated drop folder (`/mnt/<drive>/.shareos/autobrr-drop`, mode 2770) watched by the chosen user's Transmission daemon.
- Complete filter management: view, create, edit, toggle, and delete filters via autobrr's REST API.
- IRC networks and announce channels live monitoring dashboard.
- Service management: start, stop, toggle autostart on boot, and live daemon log viewer.
- Native autobrr Web UI toggle: switch port 7474 between localhost-only and network-wide exposure, with direct admin password configuration.
- Native ShareOS desktop integration: theme adaptiveness (light/dark with accents), menubar, responsive layout, and full multi-language translations (English, German, Portuguese).
